# What We Learned

### Concepts

- Ocelot
- Git Push / Commit
- Git Pull
- JS Variables
- JS Testing

### Implimentation

##### Ocelot
We started off sharing our Ocelot projects. I shared my Square.com copy with the class and I felt it went well. I have even had several students ask me for the link so that they can see how I did things as they expand their skills and that was encouraging. 

##### Git Push / Commit
This, I would have to say was my favorite part of the week. I have had a GitHub for about 4 months at this point and no real commits.  I created a few repositories manually but could not figure out how to use CmD / Terminal to make commits. I cannot explain enough how much I enjoy making these commits as silly as it sounds.

##### Git Pull / Team Work
We took out ability to make Git commits to the next level and worked within a team.  This was a huge question that I had and it was answered.  Making commits as often as posible and making the pull requests to pull down your team's work onto your local environment is..... frustrating at times. This was great practice. 

##### JavaScript Variables
We started working a little with JavaScript. We learned how to declair a variable and what it means to use that variable. 

##### JavaScript Testing
We did not really get into creating the tests but using the tests to work on our comprehension of variables. Colin set the tests and we had to create the variables so that the tests would pass within certain rules. I enjoyed this very much and I want to go further into testing.
